        DXC Angular Components is a library made for Angular applications. In order to use it,
        you need to include it in an existing Angular project.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are creating a Angular application from scratch, we recommend using
        <a href="https://angular.io/guide/setup-local" target="_blank">Angular setup</a>
        to set it up with minimum configuration.

        DXC Angular Components is distributed as an npm package. To use it in an
        existing project:

            <mat-tab label="NPM">
                <app-code-playground [code]="npmCode" type="CONSOLE" >
                </app-code-playground>
            </mat-tab>
            <mat-tab label="YARN">
                <app-code-playground [code]="yarnCode" type="CONSOLE" >
                </app-code-playground>
            </mat-tab>
        </mat-tab-group>

        The CDK uses Angular Material so if it's not added, the components
        will not work as expected.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, it is mandatory to add in your angular.json the library assets as well as the 
        indigo pink pre-built theme from Angular Material:
    </p>
    <app-code-playground [code]="assetsCode" type="CONSOLE" >
    </app-code-playground>
    <p>
        Lastly, it is also needed our ThemeModule in your app so our default theme can be 
        applied with the theme directive. 
        For more information, please go to <i>Custom Themes</i> tab.
